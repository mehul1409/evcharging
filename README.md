# Core Challenge Addressed
Insufficient convenient EV charging infrastructure, coupled with a dearth of user-friendly apps for locating private and public charging points, pose a major obstacle for EV owners. This leads to "range anxiety" and hinders longer journeys. Moreover, numerous available private charging hosts remain undiscovered due to low visibility. These collective challenges impede the widespread adoption of EVs, affecting both individuals and the environment.

# Innovative Solution
We are creating a seamless solution for locating the nearest EV charging station. But that's not all â€“ individuals can now host their own private charging stations, allowing others to conveniently access them for a small fee. This breakthrough not only ensures ample availability of chargers, but also liberates travelers from range anxiety. Plan your journeys with confidence, checking maps for charging station availability along your route. This initiative not only rapidly expands the charging network, but also creates opportunities for employment and supplementary income as hosts share their charging resources.
